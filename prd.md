**Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI-Powered Multimodal Travel Agent**
*Built on LangChain + Open-Source Components*

## 1. Executive Summary

An AI-driven travel agent that lets users **chat** (text) or **speak** (voice) to plan, search, compare and book travel (flights, hotels, cars) and experiences (tours, activities). The system orchestrates third-party APIs (Amadeus, Skyscanner, Booking.com, Viator, etc.) and a large language model (LLM) via LangChain to deliver personalized, end-to-end travel booking.

## 10. User Stories (Sample)

1. **As a** user, **I want** to say “Book me a flight to Paris next Friday” **so that** I can get options hands-free.
2. **As a** user, **I want** to filter hotels by “4 stars and above under \$200/night” **so that** I find high-quality stays within my budget.
3. **As a** user, **I want** confirmation emailed and messaged to me **so that** I have all my trip details.
4. **As a** user, **I want** the agent to remember my seat-preference and loyalty number **so that** I don’t repeat myself each time.

---

## 11. Success Metrics

* **Adoption**: ≥10% of sign-ups complete a booking within first session
* **Conversion**: ≥5% chat sessions result in a booking
* **Latency**: Median response time <1.5s
* **CSAT**: ≥4.5/5 average post-trip survey rating

## 12. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                          | Mitigation                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inconsistent API behavior     | Build resilient retry & fallback logic                     |
| Voice accuracy in noisy env’t | Offer a “confirm” step & display transcription preview     |
| Payment failures              | Integrate multiple payment gateways, clear error messaging |
| Data privacy concerns         | End-to-end encryption, explicit user consent flows         |

---

## 13. Next Steps

1. **Proof-of-Concept**: End-to-end “flight search + book” via LangChain agent
2. **API Sandbox Integration**: Connect to Amadeus & Booking sandbox keys
3. **Prototype UI**: Chat + voice demo with basic memory
4. **User Testing**: Validate multimodal flows with target personas
5. **Iterate & Expand**: Add tours, car rentals, payment flows, scale
